# .env Key Extractor

The `.env Key Extractor` is a script that allows you to copy the keys from your `.env` file while excluding their values. It also generates a README file to provide instructions on how to use it.

## Prerequisites

Before using this script, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Node.js (version X.X.X or higher)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `copyNV.js` file.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your `.env` file in the project directory.
2. Open the `copyNV.js` file in a text editor.
3. Find the following line of code:

   ```javascript
   // Insert code here to copy the .env file keys (without values)
   ```

   Replace it with your code that copies the keys from the `.env` file without their values. Ensure that the code works correctly.

4. Save the `copyNV.js` file.

5. In your terminal, run the script by executing the following command:

   ```
   node copyNV.js
   ```

6. The script will create a `README.md` file in the project directory, which will contain the instructions on how to use the script.

## Example Output

Here's an example of how the `README.md` file will look like:

```
